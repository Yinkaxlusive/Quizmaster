## Project Overview
**Quizmaster** is a full-stack web application designed to offer a dynamic and engaging quiz-taking experience. Users can sign up, take quizzes, compete in real-time challenges, and track their progress. The platform features adaptive learning powered by basic machine learning models and offers a gamified user experience.

This project is a part of my ALX Webstack specialization portfolio, where I aimed to go beyond the basics by implementing innovative features and ensuring high code quality and scalability.

## Features

### Core Features:
- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and securely access the platform via JWT authentication.
- **Quiz Selection**: Browse quizzes by categories or difficulty.
- **Adaptive Quizzes**: Adjusts the difficulty level of quizzes based on user performance.
- **Real-Time Competitions**: Compete with others in live quiz rooms.
- **Gamification**: Earn badges, track streaks, and climb the leaderboard.
- **Speech-to-Text Integration**: Answer quizzes using voice commands for accessibility.
- **User-Generated Quizzes**: Create and share quizzes with others.
- **Admin Analytics Dashboard**: Admins can view detailed statistics on quiz participation.

### Stretch Features:
- **Multi-Language Support**: Quizzes are available in multiple languages.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Optimized for mobile with offline functionality.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React**: For dynamic user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For component-based routing.
- **CSS/Bootstrap**: For responsive and modern UI design.
- **Web Speech API**: For speech-to-text integration.

### Backend:
- **Node.js/Express**: For RESTful API and backend logic.
- **MongoDB**: For data storage (users, quizzes, scores).
- **JWT**: For authentication and session management.
- **Socket.io**: For real-time quiz competitions.

### Machine Learning:
- **scikit-learn**: For adaptive quizzes based on performance.

## Architecture
The **Quizmaster** platform uses a **microservices-based architecture**, with a frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express) communicating via a REST API. MongoDB stores data, while real-time interactions are powered by **Socket.io**.

It follows the **MVC pattern**:
- **Model**: Represents quizzes, users, and scores.
- **View**: Renders UI components like quiz lists and leaderboards.
- **Controller**: Manages business logic (authentication, quiz creation, scoring).

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud instance)

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quizmaster.git
cd quizmaster
